# TranslAIte
A translator that translates text of any language to English.
Utilizing the 'madlad400-3b-mt' pretrained transformer model from Google, TranslAIte seamlessly translates text from any language into English with remarkable accuracy. With a user-friendly interface crafted with Gradio, TranslAIte tokenizes input text, generates precise English translations, and presents them elegantly to users. The model I used is opensource and available in the Huggingface website.
